I am a PhD student working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modelling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/) at the [School of GeoSciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences), the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interests primarily lie in leveraging satellite observations and cutting-edge models to understand spatiotemporal variabilities of particulate matter (PM) and PMâ€™s downstream impacts (e.g. population exposure, solar photovoltaic electricity, etc). More information about my research, teaching, and life can be found on my [personal website](https://feiyao-edinburgh.github.io/).
